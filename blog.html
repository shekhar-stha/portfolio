        Technology is something that grows and evolves over time and Over the years, technology has revolutionized
        our world and daily lives. Society and technology are not two separate things, as they grow alongside each 
        other. That means large portions of everyday life are being affected by the constant stream of innovation 
        and advancement in technology, which in turn allows us to have an even better life. Modern technology has 
        paved the way for multi-functional devices like the smartwatch and the smartphone. Computers are increasingly 
        faster, more portable, and higher-powered than ever before. With all of these revolutions, technology has also 
        made our lives more easier, faster, better, and more fun. But in the past two decades technology has grown much 
        rapidly like technology has given us smartwatches, tablets, and voice assistant devices and many more. 
        nowadays we can do things like transfer money instantly and make purchases for everything from clothes, food delivery, groceries, 
        furniture, and more. Technology has changed how we entertain ourselves, meet each other, and consume all types 
        of media. It’s made fun advancements, but it’s also made important advancements in safety when it comes to home 
        security and medical devices.

    <p class="blog-p">
        Now, in the middle of a global pandemic, technology has assumed an even greater role in the education of our kids. 
        At the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, over 1.5 billion children across the world were taken out of the classroom
        because of school closures, which, in turn, forced the widespread adoption of remote teaching technologies and the 
        suspension of in-person instruction. There are serious doubts that education will ever return to what it was. In a
        recent survey of students and faculty, 83% of students and 89% of faculty believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will 
        have a lasting impact on students in higher education.But one thing’s for sure, whether classrooms are set to permanently 
        re-open, or whether a more hybrid online/in-person approach will become the new norm, technology will be at the center of the educational experience.

    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 2rem;">Technology Affects on communication</h3>
    <img class="blog-img"src="images/video-call.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="blog-p">
        For better or worse, technology affects communication because it is a part of our everyday lives. It impacts 
        the way we work, entertain ourselves, and stay in touch. You might see the average elementary-aged child with 
        their head buried in a smartphone and tempted to take a gloomy outlook on what technology has done to us. But is it all bad?
        From a business perspective, you could argue that technology communication is beneficial. With this in mind, here’s 
        a breakdown of everything you need to know about how technology affects communication with customers, plus how to use 
        these developments to your advantage. On the one hand, technology affects communication by making it easier, quicker, and more efficient. It allows you to track 
        conversations and therefore provide better customer service. Tech also makes it easier to gather customer insights and improve the entire customer experience.
        However, some fear technology affects communication by hindering our ability to build relationships with clients and will lead to brands becoming faceless entities.

    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 2rem;">Technology Affects on productivity</h3>
    <img class="blog-img"src="images/productivity.png" alt="">
    <p class="blog-p">
        Technology has vastly increased productivity, since the ability of computers to solve complex mathematical equations has allowed 
        them to speed up practically every task. Computer modeling permits engineers to simulate structures, vehicles, and materials to 
        provide information on performance prior to prototyping. In the office, the ability of networked computers to share and manipulate 
        data can speed up a variety of tasks – permitting employees to work more efficiently and maximize productivity. Technological 
        advancements in agriculture have increased food production. In so many areas of our lives, critical time-consuming processes can 
        now be executed with ease – and in a fraction of the time they once required.
